The assymetric ladder contains proofs in the style of [State Separating Proofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/306)/[Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/)/[Crypto Companion](https://github.com/cryptocompanion/cryptocompanion).
This proof style is available in a symbolic style in the prototypes [Proof Frog](https://prooffrog.github.io/) and SSBee. A [graphical representation](https://cnrs.hal.science/hal-04524525/file/2023-1581.pdf) is also available.
A formal connection with the computational model is available in [SSProve](https://github.com/SSProve/ssprove), or as a [design principle](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/326) for [EasyCrypt](https://www.easycrypt.info/) proofs.
In the future, one could hope to use the symbolic presentations as a DSL for the SSProve or EasyCrypt.
